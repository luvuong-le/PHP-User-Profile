----------- Pure PHP User Login System ----------------

Just a small project for myself to relearn the PHP Basics.

Home Page: Comparison Slider Effect.

Login Page: Logs the user in and redirects to the user profile page.

Register Page: Registers the user with an email, hashed password and username.

Profile Page: Displays User Details from Session Variables. (Only displays username and email). Ideal would be to query from database for more complicated user database schemas.


--------------------------------- Feature ideas to add ---------------------------------

 Image uploading after registering with an user icon. Upload the image path to database and retrieve from image folder.
